# 📃 Model Evaluation

## 🛠️ Objectives
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics
- Interpret cross-validation results to assess model stability
- Provide insights for model improvement

## 🔢 Steps
1. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) for training and testing sets.
   - Analyzed R-squared values to assess model fit.
2. **Cross-Validation Analysis:**
   - Evaluated model performance across 5 cross-validation folds.
   - Identified fold inconsistencies and assessed potential issues.
3. **Performance Summary:**
   - Compared baseline, Ridge, and Lasso model results to select the best performer.

## 📊 Key Results
- **Ridge Regression Model:** Best performing model with:
  - **Training MSE:** `0.1803` | **R-squared:** `0.8243`
  - **Testing MSE:** `0.1745` | **R-squared:** `0.8104`
- **Lasso Model:** Identified as less effective for this dataset.
- **Cross-Validation:** Fold 4 identified as inconsistent, requiring further investigation.

## 🔍 Next Steps
- Document insights for stakeholders and provide recommendations for data strategy improvements.
