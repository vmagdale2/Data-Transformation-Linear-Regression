# 📃 Modeling

## 🛠️ Objectives
- Build baseline and regularized regression models
- Evaluate model performance using key metrics
- Perform cross-validation for robustness

## 🔢 Steps
1. **Baseline Model:**
   - Implemented Linear Regression as the baseline model.
2. **Ridge Regression:**
   - Used Ridge Regression to reduce overfitting and improve model stability.
3. **Lasso Regression:**
   - Applied Lasso Regression for feature selection and complexity reduction.
4. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Applied 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model robustness and performance.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Identified the optimal alpha value for Ridge and Lasso models using `GridSearchCV`.
6. **Data Export:**
   - Saved trained models and evaluation metrics for future reference.

## 📊 Key Results
- **Baseline Linear Regression Model:** R-squared = `0.8042` (Training) | `0.7887` (Testing)
- **Ridge Regression Model:** R-squared = `0.8243` (Training) | `0.8104` (Testing)
- **Lasso Regression Model:** R-squared = `0.7548` (Training) | `0.7254` (Testing)

## 🔍 Next Steps
- Perform model evaluation and identify actionable insights for stakeholders.
